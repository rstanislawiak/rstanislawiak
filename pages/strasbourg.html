                    <h1>Report on the Inaugural Student Assembly in Strasbourg</h1>

                    <p>Radoslaw Stanislawiak</p>
                    <p>March 17, 2022</p>
                    <h1></h1>
                    <p>On March 3-4 2022, the inaugural gathering of students from European organizations was held in
                        Strasbourg. The event was held in the framework of cooperation between the European Commission
                        and the European Parliament.</p>
                    <h1></h1>
                    <p>After more than two months of preparation on the panel, together with a group of students from
                        various European universities, I presented proposals on social networking sites and how the
                        European Union can regulate them, without restrictions on freedom of speech.</p>
                    <h1></h1>
                    <p>I believe that our recommendations for improving online platforms under the eye of transparency
                        and security will be considered for a better future for Europe by members of the European
                        Parliament.</p>
                    <h1></h1>
                    <p>A total of 10 panels were held, with nearly 300 students participating. Some of the topics
                        included agriculture and sustainable development, an economic model for the Union, the need for
                        a European Health Union and an inclusive digitized higher education system. All panels were held
                        in compliance with all sanitary recommendations.</p>
                    <h1></h1>
                    <p>I was proud to represent Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznan and the Association of European
                        Universities EPICUR, as one of several students from Poland. In Strasbourg, each participant had
                        the pleasure of visiting the second largest plenary hall in the world. What's more, he also had
                        the opportunity to join the discussion and actively participate in it, while discussing the
                        rethinking of European democracy.</p>
                    <h1></h1>
                    <p>This event showed that young people can, as well as, have a huge impact on the future. Together
                        with the right expert support, remarkable results can be achieved. We met many inspiring people
                        who represent the Ministry of Education and Science, the Union of Universities, as well as the
                        European Parliament. I recommend everyone to work in a cross-cultural team, because we shared
                        many opinions and got to know each other. Together we have great ideas to develop our
                        environment so that it is filled with many unique opportunities for us.</p>
