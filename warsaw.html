                    <h1>Report on European Universities Student Ambassador Forum (EUSAF) in Warsaw</h1>
                    <p>Radoslaw Stanislawiak</p>
                    <p>12-14 September 2024</p>
                    <h1></h1>
                    <p>Around 30 student representatives from different university alliances participated in the European Universities Student Ambassador Forum in Warsaw. The forum focused on analyzing activities of university alliances across Europe and networking to share good practices. There were workshops on two main topics: 1) exploring the role of student ambassadors and identifying key priorities of the initiative and 2) local level engagement, discussing how to foster activities and engage with the local community.</p>
                    <p>The first workshop allowed us to brainstorm about the student role and missions in building bridges between all parties in the alliance, emphasizing that students and universities together form an alliance. The second workshop guided us on finding stakeholders for our local university and alliance, showing us how to network locally and communicate our goals to attract attention from universities, non-governmental organizations, and private businesses.</p>
                    <p>Throughout the forum, participants took part in a contest presenting posters that highlighted the best practices of their respective alliances, with voting determining the top selections. On the last day, there was a panel discussion with the three winners who received the most votes: EUGREEN, EPICUR, and EUNICE. During the discussion, the EPICUR representative, Radoslaw Stanislawiak, talked about research-based education, sustainability, and unifying regions. He also presented EPICUR's wide range of course catalogs with transversal skills and various mobility programs in physical, virtual and blended formats.</p>
                    <p>At the end of the forum, there was a wrap-up session focusing on effective communication about European university alliances. This session provided insights from many representatives as they discussed their experiences, challenges, and possible solutions to make European university alliances recognizable to all.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, the forum provided valuable perspectives on the role of student ambassadors, generated ideas for improving communication strategies, and created a network of alliance ambassadors that they want to maintain to share good practices for the future of European universities.</p>
